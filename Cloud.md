## What's Cloud Computing and why is it important?

Cloud Computing delivers compute resources over the Internet via pay-as-you-go pricing. This is important beacuse it enables (1) agility, since companies do not need to pay upfront for compute, (2) elasticity, since companies do not need to over-provision resources up front to deal with peaks in business activity, (3) cost, since companies can trade upfront expenses for variable expenses (with the added benefit of economies of scale), (4) performance - cloud companies have servers all over the world which you can deploy to, enabling reductions in latency.  

## Why is Cloud Computing important for YOU?

As you may have read above, cloud computing (AWS) is used in several modules - namely InfoProc and the 2nd year project. If you are an aspiring developer, it'll come in extremely useful during work ([most companies engage a major cloud provider one way or another](https://aws.amazon.com/industries/?nc2=h_ql_sol_ind_id)).

## Advice

- Learn Infrastructure-as-Code, it's the modern standard to deploy and interact with cloud resources. Picking up [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/infrastructure-as-code) and doing a few projects with it serves as a good starting point. Terraform is good because it's cross-platform, meaning that it works with any cloud provider.
- Get to know your Python, Linux and Networking fundamentals first. I recommend watching [this series of videos](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/tech-fundamentals).
