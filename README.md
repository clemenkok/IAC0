# IAC0: A Repository to plug the missing gaps

There are several important skills that are needed to succeed in second year. This repository contains several tutorials on how to pick them up. It is recommended that you spend some time learning the basics below as the year goes by. Some are relevant for the IAC lab (Linux, Git), so check them out before the first lab.

Feel free to create a pull request.

## General Advice

- Start your internship hunt early (like right now). Use a popular CV template such as [Jake's CV Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs).  

- Learn some LaTeX - will come in handy for report writing, as many will have realised in the first year project.

- "Do LeetCode": this is some of **the worst advice** I think I received when attempting aptitude tests for internships using just my knowledge from first year's C++ content. I would highly recommend picking up JavaScript and/or Python, as these are guaranteed to be options to use for the aptitude tests, whereas I found C++ wasn't *always* there; in addition to this, JavaScript and Python are easier syntactically, allowing you to focus on the data structures and algorithms questioned. Following on from this, make sure to deepen your knowledge on structures and algorithms, *then* proceed to use Hackerrank, then answer as many LeetCode questions as you want, otherwise I found myself getting frustrated and just looking at the answers and solutions, which clearly won't help you in the tests.

Refer to the table below to find out what languages / frameworks you will need to learn:  
|Modules|Technologies|
|---|---|
|ELEC50006 Discrete Mathematics|Python|
|ELEC50011 Mathematics for Engineers IIA/B|NIL (Math)|
|ELEC50014 Software Systems|Python, SQL|
|ELEC50002 Communications|LabView|
|ELEC50004 Control Systems|MATLAB|
|ELEC50003 2nd Year Project|Depends on your subsystem. Command - React, Node.js, AWS, Control - MATLAB, Drive - C++, Vision - FPGA/C++, Power - C++, Integration - RTOS.|
|ELEC50009 Information Processing|Depends on your subsystem. If you're doing the FPGA part, you need to know how to use Quartus, C, SystemVerilog and UART (so Python). If you're doing a game, probably Unity/C# (some people used common webdev stacks too). Cloud/Databases - AWS, SQL, Python.|
|ELEC50010 Instruction Architectures and Compilers|Autumn part - SystemVerilog, C++. Spring part - C++, Flex, Bison (brush up on OOP)|
