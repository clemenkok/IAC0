### What's Docker?

Docker is a tool that lets developers easily create, deploy and run applications in a consistent and reproducible environment. It does this through containers.  

A container is a standalone executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application, including code, libraries, system tools and settings.  

Docker lets developers create container images that include applications and its dependencies, then deploy those images to systems that have Docker installed.

### The Container Analogy

A shipping container provides a standardized, secure and portable way to transport goods. Similarly, Docker provides a standardized, secure and portable way to transport software applications.

Additionally, just like how shipping containers are sealed and separated from one noather, Docker containers provide isolation and ensure that applications are not affected by conflicts with other applications/the host system.

### Getting Started

Install Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/).

The Docker [getting-started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/) tutorial is an excellent introduction to Docker.
